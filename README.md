# Tech-Acad-Projects
This is where I'm creating projects while at the Tech Academy, 2017. I finished the coding coursework in Nov 2017, but due to previous committments, I did not finish the job search course and graduate until Aug 2018. I have been working on other [udemy classes](../../../javascript-udemy) since then.

**NOTE:** I was still going to sea as a marine technician while attending the TA. The gaps in dates / submissions of a week to a month long are generally from when I was working at sea and had limited internet and time.

I also did not commit as often as I should have in the early days, so many projects only have the final version here.

Some sample projects learning web development at the Tech Academy.

My troubleshooting method to research new concepts or issues with my code was to use MDN, the documentation at microsoft, python, etc., stack overflow, w3schools and general googling to research the problem. I would then play around with various examples and when I understood it and how it worked, would incorporate it into my code. My biggest struggle was with the concept of "good enough" and after spending a certain amount of time with research to ask an instructor or look at someone else's code to see how they did it.
