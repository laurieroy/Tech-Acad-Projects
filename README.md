# Tech-Acad-Projects
This is where I'm creating projects while at the Tech Academy, 2017. I finished the coding coursework in Nov 2017, but due to previous committments, did not graduate until Aug 2018. I have been working on other [udemy classes](../../../javascript-udemy) since then.

**NOTE:** I was still going to sea as a marine technician while attending the TA. The gaps in dates / submissions of a week to a month long are generally from when I was working at sea and had limited internet and time.

I also did not commit as often as I should have in the early days, so many projects only have the final version here.

Some sample projects learning web development at the Tech Academy.
